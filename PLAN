BUGS:
- segfault when creating register map


SHORT-TERM:
- make register map creation happen immediately at runtime rather than waiting for the first packet
- complete incomplete intermediate conversion methods in known_registers.c
- test for CSV bad input data 
  - empty fields

LONG-TERM:
- structured data extraction
 - single-word sized data (uint16, etc)
 - multi-word sized data (uint32, etc - read multiple registers)
- influxdb write
